Having spent much his youth playing sport, there came a realisation form Tom that ultimately he wasn't going to play football, rugby or cricket for England, nor win any golf majors. 

Having left University he embarked on the next best thing, and went into sport television production at the newly launched Sky Sports News. Throughout his late teens and early twenties he began a love affair with racing and when the opportunity came to start working as a producer on At The Races he took it. Highlights there have been overseeing the coverage of Richard Hughes remarkable seven winners at Windsor. 

Tom is now looking forward greatly to working with the other members of the team to ensure that all those who become involved in this great new venture at The Albatross Club get the maximum enjoyment from the experience. It really promises to be a tremendous ride.
