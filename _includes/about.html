                <p>The Albatross Club is an exclusive racing club that specialises in <em>syndicated racehorse ownership</em> by bringing together
                groups of like minded, <em>fun loving race goers</em> that own a number of well bred national hunt and flat thoroughbred racehorses.
                The Albatross Club's members <em>enjoy great days at the races</em> together and get invited to <em>unique, private experiences</em> with champions
                of the sport and other celebrity members and ambassadors.</p>
                <p>The Albatross Club founders have bought and owned Group and Listed Handicap
                winners on both the flat and jumps with some of the top trainers in the country. Frankie Dettori and Jim Crowley are our ambassadorial jockeys
                and regularly ride for the Club as well as attending events with our other sporting members. If you do know a member of our club then we do hope
                you will join our club to experience the passion, excitement and fun of racehorse ownership.</p>

                <h2>THE ALBATROSS CLUB EXPERIENCE</h2>
                <p>As a member of the Albatross Club one can expect a very high level of service. Each member is treated as if he or she owned their horses outright.  Our senior management team will act as your personal racing manager, keeping you regularly informed as to the progress of your bloodstock and running plans. Whether you are based in the UK or abroad, we will keep in touch via email and on the telephone, sending photographs, and replays of winning races as well as filmed updates showing your horses on the move and featuring interviews with the trainers. We arrange regular visits to see our horses in training, giving our members the opportunity to talk to the trainers direct and feed the horses polo’s and carrots!</p>

                <p>As an example in Newmarket, owners are able to stay overnight at the prestigious Jockey Club Rooms, home of one of the finest art collections in the UK, where at dinner, owners will be joined by their trainers. The following morning owners will see their horses on Newmarket’s historic gallops, before returning to the Rooms for breakfast. On race day, arrangements are made for owners to pick up their owners badges at the Owners & Trainers desk. A member of the Albatross Club events team will be on hand at the racecourse and escort owners into the paddock before the race to meet the trainer and jockey. The Albatross Club has a private box at Ascot, where all owners have exclusive use during the Flat and National Hunt season based on available. When horses are running at major festival meetings, TAB will make arrangements for hospitality on the day as appropriate. We have similar arrangements at Newbury and Cheltenham.</p>

                <p>While our aim is to manage our bloodstock as professionally as possible, in order to maximise the horses’ potential, we also want to ensure that every owner enjoys the involvement in racehorse ownership to the full as with our events this is a social club first and foremost.</p>

                <h2>THE ALBATROSS CLUB STRUCTURE</h2>

                <p>We launch new syndicates every winter. The number of shares available per syndicate is always 10, although members can always own more than one share. The horses are always trained by what we consider the country’s most social, affable and top quality trainers including Nicky Henderson, David Pipe, Hugo Palmer and Karl Burke.
                Each shareowner enters into an agreement with the company to share in the prize money and the proceeds from the sale of the horses once the syndicate is wound up including any breeding rights that maybe sold off. The Albatross Club charge a fixed management fee for admin and 15% on the upside on any horse sold over its purchase price.</p>

                <p>We work with the trainers and leading bloodstock agents in the world to purchase the horses at the world’s principal yearling and breeze up sales. In order to comply with Jockey Club rules, the horses remain the property of TAC.</p>

                <p>After often being broken at Laundry Cottage Stud, the horses are sent to their nominated trainers. TAC keeps in close contact with the trainers, regularly visiting the yards in order to carefully monitor the progress of the horses. In combination with the trainers, each horse is managed in order to maximize its potential and future value.
                Owners have the opportunity to see their bloodstock in regular visits to the horse’s stables. We may even run a social event in London and bring the horses down to meet new members!</p>

                <p>The duration of each syndicate differs but generally lasts for a minimum of two seasons. The horses may be sold at any time throughout the duration of the syndicate and any attractive offer is always carefully considered by TAC racing board. Once all the horses are sold, the syndicate is wound up and the accounts are reviewed by the auditors. Any surplus of income over expenditure is distributed to the shareowners. In the unlikely event of a deficit, the cost will be borne by TAC thereby ensuring that no further calls for funds are ever made.</p>
